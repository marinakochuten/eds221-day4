# Create a vector of times:
time_vec <- seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 0.1)

# Apply the logistic growth function to that vector of times (& store):

# Need to create a MATRIX to store the outputs in:

# Now, a nested for loop:

for (i in seq_along(r_seq)) {  # outer loop of growth rates
  for (j in seq_along(time_vec)) { # inner loop of time steps

# pivot_longer to make it tidy (you'll learn more about this next week)
